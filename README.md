## Architecture Overview

The solution implements a modern cloud-native architecture with the following key components:

- EKS-based Kubernetes cluster for container orchestration
- Multi-environment support (staging, production)
- Automated infrastructure deployment using Terraform
- Helm-based application deployment
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging setup

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0.0
- Task (go-task) for automation
- kubectl
- helm
- terraform-docs
- tflint

## Getting Started

1. Install required tools:
```bash
task setup
```

2. Initialize the infrastructure:
```bash
task infra:init ENV=stage  # or ENV=prod
```

## Deployment Guide

1. Plan the changes:
```bash
task infra:plan ENV=stage
```

2. Apply the infrastructure:
```bash
task infra:apply ENV=stage
```

3. Verify deployment:
- Check AWS Console for resource creation
- Verify EKS cluster status
- Confirm application endpoints are accessible
- Monitor CloudWatch logs

## Infrastructure Design Decisions

### Kubernetes (EKS)
- **Why EKS?** Managed Kubernetes service reducing operational overhead
- **Node Groups:** Mix of on-demand and spot instances for cost optimization
- **Auto-scaling:** Implemented at both cluster and pod level

### Storage
- EBS for persistent workloads
- S3 for static assets and backups
- EFS for shared filesystem requirements

### Monitoring
- CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- Prometheus/Grafana for detailed application metrics
- AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing

## Networking Strategy

### VPC Design
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Private subnets for workload isolation
- Public subnets for load balancers
- NAT Gateways for outbound internet access

### Security Groups
- Layered security approach
- Principle of least privilege
- Separate security groups for different components

### Load Balancing
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Network Load Balancer (NLB) for TCP/UDP workloads
- AWS Global Accelerator for global routing optimization

## Security and Access Management

### IAM Strategy
- Pod IAM roles using IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
- Least privilege access principles
- Regular key rotation
- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data

### Network Security
- VPC Flow Logs enabled
- AWS WAF for web application protection
- AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- Private endpoints for AWS services

## CI/CD Implementation

### Pipeline Structure
1. **Build Stage**
   - Code validation
   - Unit tests
   - Container image building
   - Security scanning

2. **Infrastructure Stage**
   - Terraform plan/apply
   - Configuration validation
   - Infrastructure tests

3. **Deployment Stage**
   - Helm chart deployment
   - Smoke tests
   - Integration tests

### Environment Promotion
- Staging environment for testing
- Production deployment after approval
- Automated rollback capabilities

## Solution Components

### Scalability
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Cluster autoscaling
- Application-level caching
- CDN integration

### High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment
- Pod anti-affinity rules
- Regular backup strategy
- Disaster recovery plan

### Fault Tolerance
- Circuit breakers
- Retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks and self-healing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Technical Improvements**
   - Service mesh implementation
   - GitOps workflow
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Chaos engineering practices

2. **Operational Improvements**
   - Cost optimization
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Automated compliance checks
   - Performance optimization

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Zero trust architecture
   - Enhanced audit logging
   - Automated security scanning
   - Compliance automation

## Trade-offs Considered

1. **Managed vs. Self-hosted Services**
   - Chose managed services (EKS, RDS) for reduced operational overhead
   - Trade-off: Higher costs but lower maintenance burden

2. **Multi-AZ vs. Single-AZ**
   - Implemented Multi-AZ for high availability
   - Trade-off: Increased costs but better reliability

3. **Spot vs. On-demand Instances**
   - Mixed usage for cost optimization
   - Trade-off: Some complexity in handling spot terminations

4. **Monitoring Granularity**
   - Comprehensive monitoring with associated costs
   - Trade-off: Storage costs vs. debugging capability
