# File Patterns to Exclude During Package Builds
# This configuration supports shell glob matching, relative path matching, and
# negation (prefixed with "!"). Each pattern should be defined on a separate line.

# Operating System Specific Files
.DS_Store              # macOS Finder metadata file, should be ignored
Thumbs.db              # Windows Explorer thumbnail cache, should be ignored

# Version Control System (VCS) Directories
.git/                  # Git directory, stores repository configuration and history
.gitignore             # Git ignore rules for excluding files
.bzr/                  # Bazaar version control directory
.bzrignore             # Bazaar ignore rules
.hg/                   # Mercurial version control directory
.hgignore              # Mercurial ignore rules
.svn/                  # Subversion version control directory

# Backup Files from Editors and IDEs
*.swp                  # Vim swap files
*.bak                  # Backup files, often created by editors
*.tmp                  # Temporary files, usually auto-generated by editors
*.orig                 # Original files created before merge conflicts
*~                     # Files ending with a tilde, usually backup files

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) Specific Files
.project               # Eclipse project metadata file
.idea/                 # JetBrains IDE project files (e.g., IntelliJ, PhpStorm)
*.tmproj               # TextMate project files
.vscode/               # Visual Studio Code workspace and user settings files
